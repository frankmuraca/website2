Over the past four weeks, more than 20 million people [have filed for unenmployment.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/business/economy/unemployment-numbers-coronavirus.html)

In mid-April the Urban Institute [released new estimates](https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/estimated-low-income-jobs-lost-covid-19) of the number of low-income jobs (<$40k salary) lost as a result of Covid-19. The estimates rely on three sources of data - the BLS, Washington State Employment Security Deparment, and 2017 LODES data - to predict job loss counts for every census track in the US.

The full methodology is [here.](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/covid-neighborhood-job-analysis)
