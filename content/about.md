Hi! My name is Frank Muraca. I'm an analyst at the [Development Finance Initiative (DFI)](https://dfi.sog.unc.edu/) at UNC-Chapel Hill's School of Government.This started this blog to write more about issues related to affordable housing policy, community development, and finance. It also hosts some of my data projects related to these topics.

I graduated in 2020 from UNC with a master's in city planning. Before that, I lived and taught in Jiangsu Province, China and wrote about issues related to how China's cities [interact with their migrant populations.](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/02/is-beijing-using-smog-cover-as-an-excuse-to-crack-down-on-rural-migrants/515805/).
