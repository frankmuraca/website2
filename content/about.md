![](/./about_files/Muraca-Frank-150x150.jpg) Hi! My name is Frank Muraca. I started this blog to write more about issues related to affordable housing policy, community development, and finance. I'm an analyst with UNC's [Development Finance Initiative (DFI)](https://dfi.sog.unc.edu/), where I work with local governments across North Carolina address their real estate and economic development challenges, with a special focus on finding ways to build and preserve affordable housing. I work with data a lot at my work, so a lot of these posts will profile ways planners can learn more about their communities using `R`, an open-source software that let's you manipulate and visualize different sources of information.

I graduated in 2020 from UNC with a master's in city planning. My research focused on how state policies [affect where affordable housing gets funded](https://nchousing.org/housing-scholars-series-how-groceries-shopping-centers-and-pharmacies-shape-the-location-of-north-carolinas-affordable-housing/) and how this impacts housing options for low-income renters. 

Before graduate school, I lived and taught in Jiangsu Province, China where I wrote about issues related to how China's cities [interact with their migrant populations.](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/02/is-beijing-using-smog-cover-as-an-excuse-to-crack-down-on-rural-migrants/515805/)
