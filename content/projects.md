# [CHASR (Shiny App)](https://frankmuraca.shinyapps.io/chasr/)

North Carolina - like the rest of the nation - faces an affordable housing crisis. There are only 43 affordable rental units [for every 100 extremely low-income households.](https://reports.nlihc.org/gap/2018/nc) In addressing their affordable housing challenges, local governments are required to make important decisions about where to allocate resources: Should policies target renters or homeowners? Are elderly or family households more impacted by rising housing costs? What does affordable mean? 

[CHASR](https://frankmuraca.shinyapps.io/chasr/) is an application that builds a profile of affordable housing challenges for each of the 100 counties in North Carolina using data from HUD. Communities can use these profiles to start a discussion on where the need for affordable housing is greatest.  

# [R Inspiration Atlas](https://frankmuraca.netlify.app/slides/r-inspiration.html)

[On Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Rstats&src=typed_query), I come across a ton of visualizations, techniques, and tips on how to creatively and effectively communicate data using `R.` Often times when I come across these links or images, I just screenshot them or keep them open on a tab for. ever.

This slidedeck is a compilation of those resources for myself and (hopefully) for others!
